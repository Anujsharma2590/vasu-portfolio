              Hello! I'm Vasukumar, and I'm based in Gujrat, India. I studied at
              P P Savani University Surat, Gujarat(India), where I completed my
              graduation in Information and Technology and currently pursuing a
              Master's degree at Queensland University of Technology in
              Australia.
              <br />
              <br />
              With over a year of experience as an Android developer and six
              months as a Delivery Partner, I've garnered valuable insights into
              the ever-evolving tech industry. These roles have not only
              deepened my understanding of software development but also
              instilled in me a strong sense of adaptability and
              problem-solving.
              <br />
              <br />
              Beyond my professional pursuits, I find solace in casual gaming,
              where I immerse myself in virtual worlds for relaxation and mental
              stimulation. Alongside this, my passion for travelling fuels my
              desire to explore new cultures and broaden my horizons. I believe
              in maintaining balance in life, embracing Diversity and Inclusion,
              and advocating for sustainability. My ultimate goal is to
              establish myself as a successful figure in Information Technology,
              with a long-term aspiration of founding my own IT firm focused on
              innovation and excellence.
